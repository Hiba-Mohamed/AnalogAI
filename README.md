# AnalogAI

**AnalogAI** is an innovative platform powered by artificial intelligence that takes complex concepts and translates them into simple, real-life analogies, helping users understand difficult ideas with ease. The platform uses advanced machine learning techniques to personalize explanations based on user preferences and learning styles.

## Features

- **User Input**: Enter a concept or idea, and the AI will generate a simple analogy to explain it.
- **Personalized Explanations**: The system adapts the analogies based on user preferences.
- **Simple Interface**: A user-friendly interface to input concepts and view the generated analogies.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Material UI, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing user data and history of concepts)
- **AI/ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow or PyTorch (for training models to generate analogies)
- **Cloud**: AWS (for deploying the platform and hosting the backend)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub (for project management and collaboration)
